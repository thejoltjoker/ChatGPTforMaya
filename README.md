# ChatGPT for Maya

This plugin allows you to chat with ChatGPT from within Maya.

## Installation

1. Start by adding the path to this repository to your `PYTHONPATH` environment variable.
2. Then add the path to the _plugin_ folder to `MAYA_PLUG_IN_PATH` environment variable.
3. While you're at it, you might as well add your OpenAI API key to the environment as well. `OPENAI_API_KEY`
4. Next up is to add the path to the folder containing the `openai` package.
    - In my case it resides in a virtual environment
      here:```C:/Users/johannes/.virtualenvs/ChatGPTforMaya-XXZNZ0Rg/lib/site-packages/```
