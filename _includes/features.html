                    Creating a horse in Autodesk Maya involves several steps, but
                    here's a general guide: <br />
                    <br />
                    1. First, create a new project in Maya by going to File > Project
                    Window > New. Set the project name, location, and file structure
                    as desired.<br />
                    <br />
                    2. Next, create a new scene by going to File > New Scene.<br />
                    <br />
                    3. Use reference images or sketches to guide your modeling. You
                    can import an image plane to use as a reference by going to View >
                    Image Plane > Import Image.<br />
                    <br />
                    4. Create a polygonal mesh for the horse's body by going to Create
                    > Polygon Primitives > Cube. Then, use the various modeling tools
                    (such as the Extrude, Bevel, and Cut tools) to shape the cube into
                    the general form of a horse's body.<br />
                    <br />
                    5. Continue adding detail to the horse's body by creating
                    additional polygonal shapes and using various modeling tools to
                    shape and refine them. For example, you may create separate
                    polygons for the head, legs, and tail, and use the Split Polygon
                    and Merge Vertices tools to join them together.<br />
                    <br />
                    6. Once the basic shape of the horse is complete, you can add
                    texture and color to the model using UV mapping and materials. You
                    can also add rigging and animation controls to create a fully
                    poseable horse model.<br />
                    <br />
                    7. Finally, render the model using Maya's built-in rendering
                    engine or an external renderer such as Arnold or V-Ray.<br />
                    <br />
                    Note that this is a simplified overview of the process, and
                    creating a realistic horse model in Maya will likely involve many
                    more steps and a significant amount of skill and experience. It's
                    recommended that you follow tutorials and practice regularly to
                    improve your modeling skills.<br />
